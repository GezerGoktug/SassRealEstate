# What is SASS 7-1 Pattern Design?

**<p>SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) 7-1 Pattern is a file organization structure created to make large and complex CSS codes more manageable and maintainable. This structure modularizes the CSS codes of a project, making it easier to maintain and provides the developer team with the opportunity to collaborate. The name "7-1" refers to 7 folders and 1 main style file in the folder structure.</p>**
